### File types
All filetypes in this repo should be stored in plain text with markup (as opposed to a binary file like docx or pdf).

#### Makado
The .mdk file extension indicates that the document was written with Madoko (www.madoko.net and madoko.org) to get the simplicity of Markdown and the mathematical formatting of LaTeX.
Use the online editor at madoko.net for editting and generating html or pdf documents. In the browser, select Save to..., choose GitHub (which will push directly to GitHub). If you prefer to work locally first, you must install the madoko-local command-line tool.

#### Markdown
Markdown (md) is a simple markup language for text formatting. Atom with the markdown-preview package are recommended for editing.

#### Latex (tex)
Latex is traditionally used in academia for scientific documents.

#### html
Standard markup language for web pages.
