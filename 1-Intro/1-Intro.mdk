# What is AI?

Some definitions from Morgan Stanley conference: The Power of Artificial Intelligence to
 Transform Business and Society

# What is AI?

* computer program that takes information from the world
* manipulates the data, distills knowledge,
* uses the knowledge to make decisions or predictions

# What is AI?

* making machines understand the world without explicitly programming for every eventuality

# What is Artificial General Inteeligence
* quest to understand the general principles and core capabilities of intelligence

# What is AI?
From Russell and Norvig:
* Artificial intelligence is the study and design of intelligence agents
where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives it's environment and
takes actions that maximizes its chances of success.

# 3 Main Types of Machine Learning
* Supervised learning: give lots of data, find model that allows you to generalize
the data and predict or classify a new piece of data never seen before
 - input data has many parameters (features) and the answer (label)
 - Mathematical models to extrapolate from this data (e.g., line of best fit or linear regression,
 k-nearest-neighbours)

* Unsupervised learning: give lots of data, try to similarities in data
 - input data is not labelled, trying to find classifications/clusters/similarities based on the features
 
* Reinforcement learning: give the algorithm rewards if it wins, let it try by trial and error and learn from its mistakes

# Why is AI everywhere?

* lots of data
* lots of compute
* developments and breakthroughs in algorithms and research

# Example application
How about an application that alerts the public to high crime areas?

* Montreal releases [data] about crimes and where the occur (the the nearest intersection)
* there are already [visualization] apps
* wouldn't it be in the public interest to provide a map that warns people if they enter a high crime area?

# What could possibly go wrong?

ML is based on past data. What are some problems with using past data for predictive apps?

* any biases in the data will cause biased results
* always ask yourself: is my data correct and representative?
  + is the sample of data on which is train my models really representative?
  + is there inherent bias in my data?
  
Most importantly *can the bias cause harm?*

# Example - Amazon 

Amazon had to scrap an AI tool it was using for hiring decisions when it realized the tool had taught itself 
to be biased against women.

![amazon]

```The team had been building computer programs since 2014 to review job applicantsâ€™ resumes with the
 aim of mechanizing the search for top talent...But by 2015, the company realized its new system was 
 not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way. ```

# What about our crime app?

* crime stats can be biased: `Despite roughly equal usage rates, Blacks are 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana.`
* "self-perpetuating": if people avoid all poor neighbourhoods, these neighbourhoods will become poorer

# How to move forward?

* be aware of potential bias
* counteract the bias
* use tool like [FairML] to audit your algorithms

The humble developer has more power available than every before: please be prudent!
